## DAOC DAO

DAOC DAO is an employee-owned and non-profit organization working on lots of cuntting-edge technology, but our ultimate goal is focusing on how to **build a sustainable, self-evolving society populated by robots**.

We believe that building such a robot society requires solving three basic questions, see below for an index of those questions and related technical exploration:

### Can robots invent their own language?

### How robots can communicate credibly?

### How can a robot society evolve itself?
