# DAOC DAO

DAOC DAO is an employee-owned and non-profit organization working on lots of cuntting-edge technology, but our ultimate goal is focusing on how to **build a sustainable, self-evolving society populated by robots**.

## Why we need to build a robot society?

We consider this issue for two reasons:

First, humans will eventually be bitten back by their own greed and selfish nature, which leading to its destruction.

Second, humans are not suitable for long-distance interstellar travel, nor are they suitable for surviving in harsh alien environments.

We believe that building such a robot society requires solving three basic questions, see below for an index of those questions and related technical exploration:

## Can robots invent their own language?

## How robots can communicate credibly?

## How can a robot society evolve itself?
